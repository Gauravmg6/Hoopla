"# Hoopla" - My first MERN project. Re-adding it due to git errors and it was in a different github account

Hoopla - Innovative E-Commerce Platform (NodeJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS, MongoDB, Material UI, CSS, Jasmine)
Designed an Amazon-inspired online shopping app, powered by the MERN stack for a seamless journey and efficient data handling.
Applied Material-UI to elevate the platform's visual aesthetics, establishing Hoopla as an innovative, secure, and stylish one-click destination.
